# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## XDS110 MCP Server - LLM Co-Debugger for TI Embedded Systems

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-21  
**Status:** Active Development

---

## Executive Summary

The XDS110 MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation that enables Large Language Models to function as intelligent co-debuggers for Texas Instruments embedded systems. The server provides real-time variable monitoring, direct memory manipulation, and domain-specific analysis capabilities through an OpenOCD multi-client proxy architecture.

This represents the first MCP server specifically designed for embedded systems debugging, addressing the critical need for intelligent debugging assistance in complex motor control and embedded applications.

## Problem Statement

### Current Debugging Challenges

Embedded systems debugging, particularly for motor control applications, presents several challenges:

1. **Exclusive Hardware Access**: Traditional debugging tools allow only one connection to debug hardware, preventing simultaneous use of different debugging approaches
2. **Manual Variable Analysis**: Engineers must manually monitor and correlate dozens of variables during debugging sessions
3. **Domain Knowledge Gap**: Complex motor control principles (FOC, alignment procedures, fault analysis) are not readily accessible during debugging
4. **Time-Intensive Troubleshooting**: Issues like motor humming, overcurrent faults, and calibration problems require extensive manual analysis

### Specific Technical Problems

- **Motor Humming During Bypass Alignment**: PMSM motors hum instead of spinning during bypass alignment sequences, requiring analysis of bypass variables, current control initialization, and encoder states
- **Complex State Machine Debugging**: Motor control state machines (IDLE → ALIGNMENT → CTRL_RUN) require simultaneous monitoring of multiple variables
- **Memory Structure Access**: Direct manipulation of embedded union structures (like debug_bypass) is limited by debugger expression evaluation capabilities
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Need for continuous monitoring with intelligent pattern recognition and anomaly detection

### Key Technical Innovation: OpenOCD Multi-Client Proxy

The solution leverages OpenOCD's multi-client capabilities to overcome hardware access limitations:

1. **Single Hardware Connection**: OpenOCD connects to XDS110 using native driver support
2. **Multiple Client Support**: OpenOCD's GDB server supports multiple simultaneous connections via `-gdb-max-connections`
3. **Intelligent GDB Client**: MCP server acts as a specialized GDB client with domain knowledge
4. **CCS Compatibility**: Code Composer Studio can connect through session handoff mechanism
